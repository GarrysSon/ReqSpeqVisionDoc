Meridian's Vision Document For the Betterment Of Peace and Prosperity Of the People On Nimbus III

1 - Intro:

	1.1 Purpose:

		This document is used to define how the "INSERT NAME HERE" system will be developed
		and operate.

	1.2 Product Overview:

		The "INSERT NAME HERE" system will track the general state and position of company
		owned fleet vehicles.

	1.3 References:

		Will list any applicable government regulations.		

2 - User Description:
	
	2.1 User/Market Description:

		The users would be companies or entities that require management of a large fleet of
		vehicles in order to streamline tracking and maintenance, or to facilitate correction
		of errant drivers. 

	2.2 User Profiles:

		N/A

	2.3 User Environment:

		Given that our software will be web-based, users will be able to access it from multiple
		sources, such as: desktops, laptops, tablets, or phones.  Thus, the environment is user
		dependent and not necessarily easy to scope.
	
	2.4 Key User Needs:

		2.4.1 The user needs to be able to track the location of an arbitrary number of vehicles.

		2.4.2 The user also needs to be able to keep tabs on top speeds achieved during any
			given use of a vehicle.
		
		2.4.3 The user requires notifications for the arrival and departure of any and
			all vehicles.

		2.4.4 Notifications informing about the running state of the vehicle are also required.

		2.4.5 Software should make note of any anomalies with regard to route and/or 
			schedule deviation.

		2.4.6 Data collected needs to be stored for a yet-to-be-clarified period of time.

	2.5 Alternatives and Competition:

		2.5.1 US Fleet Tracking.
		
		2.5.2 Fleet Tracking.
		
		2.5.3 Verizon Networkfleet.

		2.5.4 Teletrac.

		2.5.5 Fleetmatics.

		2.5.6 Fleet Tracker.

		2.5.7 Fleet Complete.

		2.5.x . . . ad nauseum.

3 - Product Overview

	3.1 Product Perspective:

		The product will be integrated with already existing hardware, and interacts with users
		through push notifications and data logs.

	3.2 Product Position Statement:

		Advertisement is not applicable.

	3.3 Summary of Capabilities:

		Summarized under 2.4 Key User Needs.

	3.4 Assumptions and Deployment:

		Training will be needed for use of software by the client.  Given that the product is
		a web service, and hardware manufacturer will install required software components on
		the hardware, deployment is assumed to be straightforward.

	3.5 Cost and Pricing:

		We will question the client in order to get a better understanding of what a realistic
		price goal would be for the product.
